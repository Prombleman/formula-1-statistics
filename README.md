# **Formula 1 Race Statistics and Data Viewer (WIP)**

This is a **work-in-progress** application designed to **summarize and display data** from Formula 1 races. Built using **PostgreSQL**, **QT5**, and **Python**, the application aims to provide an interactive interface to explore the statistics of **racers** and their **teams**.

## **Features (Planned)**

- **Race Data**: Display the dates and locations of Formula 1 races.
- **Racer Statistics**: Show statistics for individual racers, including race performances and overall results.
- **Team Statistics**: Display information on teams, their performance, and race results.
- **Interactive Interface**: An intuitive **QT5** GUI to explore race data and statistics.
- **Data Storage**: Use of **PostgreSQL** for efficient data storage and querying.

## **Technologies Used**

- **PostgreSQL**: For storing race and driver data in a structured format.
- **QT5**: To create the graphical interface for user interaction.
- **Python**: Core language for logic, database interactions, and data processing.

## **Current Status**

The application is under development. While some features are already functional, others are still being implemented. Please feel free to try out the existing functionality, and check back for updates as new features are added.
